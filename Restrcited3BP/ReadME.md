This can serve as a begining for students who wants to start their research in 3 body problem. There are many resources and files in GitHub,
I have uploaded this because if difficulties I faced and lack of support. 

I am still not clear in doing robust cointinuation etc for halo rbit families., as I work alone in this field. 

People who find mistakes can kindly inform me. I am open to help and be helped. 


This file currently only calculates few parameters w.r.t the Lyapunov orbits. Please read the Instructions. I will add manifolds for the 
Lyapunov orbits in future 

At this point of time I would like to thank 

Prof Shane Ross -  His MATLAB files and book where the first guidance
Please Visit "http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~sdross/" to see his vast area of research in nonlinear dynamics

Joshua Fitzgerald -  Student of professor Shane Ross who gave timely guidance

Ari Rubinsztejn -  Alabama University
Please visit his website "https://gereshes.com/" for some cool dynamical systems animations.

If the documentation inside the files are not clear please feel free to contact me at 
"N28067010@gs.ncku.edu.tw"


PLease use MATLAB 2017b or later. Certain commands wont work in earlier versions.  


NOTE: If I have missed credits please let me know .
